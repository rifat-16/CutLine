### 4. Storage Security Rules

Add this to Firebase Console > Storage > Rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null
        && request.resource.size < 5 * 1024 * 1024 // 5MB limit
        && request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*');
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Android Configuration
